# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Fix

## Problem

Streamlit Cloud is stuck at "Spinning up manager process..." because it's not picking up the updated `requirements.txt` without OCR dependencies.

## Solution: Force a Fresh Deployment

### Option 1: Reboot the App (Quick)

1. Go to https://share.streamlit.io/
2. Find your app: **haas-ai**
3. Click "⋮" (three dots) → **"Reboot app"**
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for fresh deployment
5. Check logs again

### Option 2: Delete and Redeploy (Nuclear Option)

1. Go to https://share.streamlit.io/
2. Find your app: **haas-ai**
3. Click "⋮" → **"Delete app"**
4. Click **"New app"**
5. Select:
   - Repository: `arulmabr/haas_expense_automation`
   - Branch: `main`
   - Main file: `streamlit_expense_app.py`
6. **IMPORTANT**: Add your secrets in "Advanced settings" → "Secrets"
7. Deploy!

### Option 3: Clear Cache

1. Go to app settings
2. Click "⋮" → **"Settings"**
3. Look for **"Clear cache"** or **"Clear build cache"**
4. Reboot app

## What Should Happen

After a successful deployment, the logs should show:

```
[timestamp] 🖥 Provisioning machine...
[timestamp] 🎛 Preparing system...
[timestamp] ⛓ Spinning up manager process...
[timestamp] 📦 Installing requirements...
[timestamp] ✅ Installed packages
[timestamp] 🐍 Starting Python app...
[timestamp] INFO - Application starting
[timestamp] INFO - Run method completed successfully
```

## Verify the Fix

Once deployed, check:

1. **Logs show**: "Application starting" and "Run method completed successfully"
2. **App loads**: You see the title "AI-Powered Expense Report Generator (GPT-5)"
3. **No errors**: Sidebar shows "✅ OpenAI API Key Found"

## If Still Stuck

The issue might be:

1. **Secrets not configured** - Make sure `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `google_credentials` are in Streamlit Cloud secrets
2. **Wrong Python version** - Streamlit Cloud should use Python 3.10+
3. **GitHub sync issue** - Try pushing a dummy commit to force sync:
   ```bash
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Force redeploy"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Current Requirements (Should Work)

```
streamlit>=1.28.0
pandas>=2.0.0
openai>=1.50.0
gspread>=5.10.0
google-auth>=2.20.0
google-auth-oauthlib>=1.0.0
google-auth-httplib2>=0.1.0
Pillow>=10.0.0
requests>=2.31.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
```

✅ No OCR dependencies (PyPDF2, pdf2image, pytesseract)
✅ No system packages needed
✅ Should deploy cleanly on Streamlit Cloud
