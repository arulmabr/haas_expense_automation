## Security Notes

- Never commit API keys or credentials to version control
- Use environment variables or Streamlit secrets for sensitive data
- Regularly rotate API keys and service account credentials
- Consider implementing additional access controls for production use

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"OpenAI Not Connected"**

   - Check your API key is correct and has GPT-4 access
   - Verify you have sufficient API credits

2. **"Google Sheets Not Connected"**

   - Ensure the service account JSON is properly formatted
   - Check that the Google Sheet is shared with the service account email
   - Verify the Sheets API is enabled in your Google Cloud project

3. **OCR Not Working**

   - Install Tesseract OCR for your platform
   - For Docker deployments, add Tesseract to your Dockerfile

4. **Exchange Rate Errors**
   - Bank of Canada API may be temporarily unavailable
   - The app will fall back to manual entry prompts

### Performance Tips

- For large batches of documents, process in smaller chunks
- Higher confidence scores generally indicate better extraction quality
- Review low-confidence extractions manually
